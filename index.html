During my time in the field, I have enhanced and practiced skills like adaptability, and curiosity that have helped me with this shift in my career. My mission is to create a safe, supportive space for underrepresented engineers to connect.

Over the course of my time at Road 2 Hire, I was able to create web pages, not only by myself but also with a team. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply and expand on my knowledge.   </div>
