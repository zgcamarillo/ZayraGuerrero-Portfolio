            <h2>Professional Development</h2>
            <p>During my time at Road To Hire, I focused on building a strong professional foundation alongside my technical growth. Through workshops, mock interviews, and project-based experience, I strengthened my ability to receive feedback, present ideas confidently, and approach new challenges with a growth mindset. I learned how to communicate clearly, collaborate with peers, and manage my time in a fast-paced environment. This foundation prepares me to navigate in a professional setting with confidence and a strong work ethic.</p>

            <h2>Technical</h2>
            <p>When I began my apprenticeship at Road to Hire, I had no prior technical experience. Through hands-on training, and consistent learning, I developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript whilst managing my projects with Git and GitHub. This program has taught me how to break down complex problems, debug, and write clean, functional code. This experience highlights my adaptability and commitment to learning new technologies.</p>

            <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
            <p>This apprenticeship has really challenged me to not only grow professionally, but also personally. Starting with a lack of confidence in my abilities, I learned to remain resilient and stay motivated in a fast-paced learning enviroment. Entering this new journey required persistence and adaptability, both in which I have learned to embrace. Over time, I developed great confidence in my abilities, and learned to approach new challenges with patience and perseverance. </p>
