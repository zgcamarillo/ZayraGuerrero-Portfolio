            <h2>Proffessional Development</h2>
            <p>During my time at Road To Hire, I focused on building a strong proffessional foundation alongside my technical growth. Through workshops, mock interviews, and project-based experience, I strengthened my ability to recieve feedback, present ideas confidently, and approach new chalenges with a growth mindset. I learned how to communticate clearly, collaborate with peers, and manage my time in a fast-paced enviroment. This foundation prepares me to navigate in a proffessional setting with confidence and a strong work ethic.</p>

            <h2>Technical</h2>
            <p>When I began my apprentiship at Road to Hire, I had no prior technical experience. Through hands on training, and consistent learning, I developed  a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript whilst managing my projects with Git and Github. This program has taught me how to break down complex problems, debug, and write clean, functional code. This experience highlights my adaptability and commitment to learning new technologies.</p>

            <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
            <p>This apprentiship has really challenged me to not only grow proffessionally, but also personally. Starting with a lack of confidence in my abilities, I learned to remain resilient and stay motivated in a fast-paced learning enviroment. Entering this new journey required persistence and adaptibility, both in which I have learned to embrace. Overtime, I developed great confidence in my abilities, and learned to approach new challenges with patience and perserverance. </p>
